## About the Project
An interactive aerospace 3D engineering inspector and flight verification interface. Inspect alloy metallurgy, hollow cylindrical wall dimensions, axial stage layout, propulsion thermochemistry, and flight dynamics.

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Model**: Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, click any section to inspect engineering specs.
- **Hand-Only Webcam Gesture Control**:
  - 🖐️ **Open Hand**: Move horizontally to continuously rotate the view; move closer/farther to zoom in/out with apparent hand depth.
  - ✊ **Fist (Hold 300ms)**: Trigger Exploded View.
  - ✌️ **Peace Sign (Hold 300ms)**: Collapse Model.
  - 🚫 **No Hand / Stillness**: Naturally holds position while mouse/keyboard remain fully active.
- **Exploded View & Scrubber**: Real-time axial and radial stage separation slider.
- **Aerodynamic Stability Markers**: Center of Gravity (CG) and Center of Pressure (CP) glyphs with caliber margin callout.
- **Subsystem Engineering Inspector**: Materials, axial coordinates, outer/inner diameter, wall thickness, itemized masses.
- **Mission Analysis & Verification**: NASA CEA thermochemistry, solid rocket motor curves (M1928), flight simulation trajectory, fin flutter safety margins, and launch rail exit velocities.
